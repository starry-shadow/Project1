            <h1>Prairie</h1>
            <p>Prairie architecture is a type of architecture that relfects its natrual surrounding and its design is mean't to be functional and open.
                <br> It is mostly found in the American Midwest.
                <br> Prairie architecture took flight after the Chicago World Fair in 1853 due to architects being dissapointed in neo classical architecture and wanted to bring something new and unconventional to the midwest.
                <br> Prarie Architecture is very linear and consists of sharp lines and basic geometric shapes.
