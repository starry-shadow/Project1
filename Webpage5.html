            <h1>High-Tech</h1>
            <p>High-Tech arcitecture is on 30 years old and has only become possible due to computers. 
                <br>With the help of computers arcitects have now been able to create much more abstract and bold buildings.
            <br> High-Tech arcitecture consits of abstract shapes such as sharp curves, or ribbion like shape, in short the shape is unconventional, a non traditional shape of architecture.
        <br> High-Tech arcitecture also consists of a principle called Deconstructivism, where the basic shapes of the building have been broken down or disassembled along with the structural support of the building being hidden from sight.
    <p>Examples of High-Tech architecture:</p>
        <img src="Sydney-Opera-House.jpg" width="600" height="400">
        <p>Jorn Utzon's Sydney Opera House</p>
        <img src="Guggenheim-Museum-Bilbao.jpg">
        <p>Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum Bilbao</p>
        <img src="Michael-Lee-Chin-Crystal.jpg">
        <p>Daniel Libeskind's Michael Lee Crystal</p>
        <p>Fun Fact: Daniel Libeskind was hired by the Royal Ontario Museum to make an exhibit, Seeing as what he made was High-Tech he decided to merge it with the traditional building of the museum.</p>
