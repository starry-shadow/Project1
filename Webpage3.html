            <h1>Art-Deco</h1>
            <p>Art-Deco is an illustrious architectural style that was conceived of during the roaring twenties. 
                <br> This was a time period when wealth, fashion, and technology was spreading to all.
                <br>The design of buildings during the time were supposed to reflect the time, the wealth and prosperity america had been facing. 
                <br> Arhcitects designed many skyscrapers during this time. 
                <br>Art-Deco was heavily influcened by cubism(a blocky architect style), and combined organic materiels together paired with ancient Egyptian, Native American, Mesoamerican, Japenenese and other cultures designs. </p>
